# TO DO:

- Make the numeric steppers actually affect the note color

- Add a button to delete a note, and make it so you dont have to restart upon deleting a note

- Make the Buttons go ontop of a FlxUI object instead of a slightly transparent black rectangle

- Make the notes invisible and inactive if off-screen

If i forgot anything, be sure to add it here

NOTE TO APOLLO:

STOP ADDING THE BACKUP COLORS FOLDER. its entirely unneccassary, and doesn't need to be there.

i'll make the missing color data file checker add those colors if it cant find data/(colorPath)/(colorFile) by the end, but just don't re add that folder.
