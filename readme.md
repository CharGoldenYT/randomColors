# TO DO:

- Make the numeric steppers actually affect the note color

- Make it possible to delete a note

- Make the Buttons go ontop of a FlxUI object instead of a slightly transparent black rectangle

- Make the randomizer script actually read from the resulting files

If i forgot anything, be sure to add it here
