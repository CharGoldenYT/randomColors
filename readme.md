# TO DO:

- Make the numeric steppers actually affect the note color

- Add a button to delete a note, and make it so you dont have to restart upon deleting a note

- Make the Buttons go ontop of a FlxUI object instead of a slightly transparent black rectangle

If i forgot anything, be sure to add it here
