- $${\color{red}(High Priority) \space Make \space the \space numeric \space steppers \space actually \space affect \space the \space note \space color}$$

- $${\color{red}(High Priority) \space Add \space a \space button \space to \space delete \space a \space note, \space and \space \color{lightblue}(Low Priority) \space make \space it \space so \space you \space dont \space have \space to \space restart \space upon \space deleting \space a \space note}$$

- $${\color{lightblue}(Low Priority) \space Make \space the \space Buttons \space go \space ontop \space of \space a \space FlxUI \space object \space instead \space of \space a \space slightly \space transparent \space black \space rectangle}$$

- $${\color{lightblue}(Low Priority) \space Make \space the \space notes \space invisible \space and \space inactive \space if \space off-screen}$$

If i forgot anything, be sure to add it here

NOTE TO APOLLO:

STOP ADDING THE BACKUP COLORS FOLDER. its entirely unneccassary, and doesn't need to be there.

i'll make the missing color data file checker add those colors if it cant find data/(colorPath)/(colorFile) by the end, but just don't re add that folder.
