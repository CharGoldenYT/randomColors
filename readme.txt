# This project was originally a commission for Apollo (aka [MC07](https://gamebanana.com/members/1945940)) but fell through due to a falling out had between me and him.

As of 12/4/24 I have taken full ownership of Random Colors, and Apollo is not allowed to re-use ANY code from this or any of my mods.
This has happened due to recent egregious actions I won't get into here.

If you see this Apollo, please seek help man.
